    <description>The Pacific Star Oil Platform is under attack. A hacker is attempting to gain access to cause a hazardous spill of the region's oil production and is using four attack hubs located around the state.

Take out the attacking hubs by selecting them and then correctly answering the questions. All four hubs must be taken offline before the platform's defenses are depleted.

Good Luck!

    <levelFailure>You failed to protect the oil platform.

The hacker penetrated the network and caused environmental damage to the ocean. The target appreciates your efforts but is now forced to pay for costly cleanups and improvements to its network defenses. Many species of ocean life are now endangered.

There is no time to rest. You should improve your skills to try to stop the hacker once again.
