Take out the attacking towers by selecting them and then correctly answering the questions. All four towers must be taken offline before the bank's defenses are depleted.

    <levelFailure>You have failed to protect the bank's records.

The hacker penetrated the network and stole the personal information of thousands of customers. The bank appreciates your efforts, but it is now forced to reimburse customers for their losses and make costly improvements to its network defenses.

There is no time to rest. You should improve your skills and prepare yourself to try to stop the hacker once again.
